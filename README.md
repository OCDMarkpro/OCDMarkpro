- 👋 Hi, I’m @OCDMarkpro
- 👀 I’m interested in java programming, android development, pentesting and in the future game development also. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and almost done with it. Also learning android software development and pentesting. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone professional in above areas and any other developers to learn from them. 
- 📫 If any opportunity arises, you can reach me via my email on markwizy5@gmail.com.
